# cellular automaton with memory

## Initial Experiments with non-Markovian cellular automaton 

If you explicitly redefine the “state” of the automaton to include its memory (e.g. track last d steps as part of the state), then it becomes Markov again — but in an extended state space. So it is kind of a lie to call this non-markovian. However I'm using the term because this project was inspired by Jacob Barandes ideas about non-markovian quantum mechanics.
